# Homework 2 - Count Positive Numbers in Scheme

This project is a simple functional programming exercise written in Scheme. It demonstrates core functional programming principles such as recursion, predicate functions, and immutability. The main objective is to count the number of positive numbers in a list.

## Objective

Implement a function `count-positive` that takes a list of numbers and returns the count of positive numbers (strictly greater than zero) using recursion.

## Features

- Written in standard Scheme syntax
- Uses recursion as the core control flow mechanism
- Utilizes a separate predicate function to check positivity
- Adheres to functional programming principles
- Includes multiple test cases for validation
